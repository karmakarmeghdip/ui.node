# Node Skia UI - Development Progress & TODO

*Last updated: August 29, 2025*

> **Development Context**: This project is being developed during evening hours after a day job. Deadlines are intentionally relaxed and realistic to maintain steady progress without burnout.

## üéØ Current Status Overview

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Strong Foundation with Core Components Working
After thorough codebase analysis, the project has significantly more implemented than originally documented. Most core systems are functional and integrated.

**What's Actually Done:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete UI Tree System** - Full UINode implementation with Element, Text, Image, Path types.
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Signals Integration** - Reactive state management with proper subscriptions for styles and input.
- ‚úÖ **Full Layout Engine** - Complete Yoga Layout integration with position calculation.
- ‚úÖ **Layout-Integrated Painting** - Painting is automatically triggered from the layout pass for dirty nodes.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Style System** - Rich style types with layout/visual property separation.
- ‚úÖ **Working Draw Queue Renderer** - Producer-consumer model with command processing, correctly hooked into the window's `frame` event.
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Window Support** - Window creation, management, and proper cleanup.
- ‚úÖ **Basic Input Management** - Hit-testing and `hovered`/`clicked` signal management in `Input.ts`.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - Layout.test.ts and Renderer.test.ts with 100+ test cases.

## üöß **ACTUAL GAPS** - Final Integration Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Element Renderers ‚ö° **HIGH PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **September 10, 2025***

- [ ] **Text Rendering** *(~1-2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Text` element type.
  - [ ] Use `skia-canvas` context to draw text based on `style` properties (`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `color`).
  - [ ] Implement basic text measurement if needed for layout.
  
- [ ] **Image & Path Rendering** *(~1-2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Image` element type, including asynchronous image loading.
  - [ ] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Path` element type, using `skia-canvas` to render SVG-like path data.

### Phase 2: Full Interactivity üéÆ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **September 25, 2025***

- [ ] **Enhance Input Manager** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Add event handler properties to `UINode` types (e.g., `onClick`, `onHover`, `onKeyDown`).
  - [ ] In `Input.ts`, invoke these handlers on the corresponding nodes when events occur.
  - [ ] Add support for keyboard events and focus management.

- [ ] **Demo Application** *(~1-2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Fix missing `./test/demo_app` import in `demo_api.js` or create a new entry point.
  - [ ] Create a working demo that showcases interactive elements (buttons, hover effects) to validate the event system.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features üöÄ **LOW PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **October 15, 2025***

- [ ] **Style Parser** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement string-based style parsing (e.g., CSS-like or Tailwind-like).
  
- [ ] **Scrollable Elements** *(~3-4 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement viewport clipping and scroll offset management.
  
- [ ] **JSX/TSX Support** *(~4-5 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Set up a JSX runtime to convert JSX syntax into `Element()` factory calls.

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL DEBT & IMPROVEMENTS**

- [ ] **Optimize Layout Performance**: Investigate if the current approach of recalculating layout on any style change can be optimized to only affect the relevant sub-tree.
- [ ] **Error Handling & Validation**: Add input validation for style properties and graceful error handling for asset loading.

## üìã **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (This Week)

1.  **Priority 1: Implement Text Rendering** - Create the paint logic for the `Text` element.
2.  **Priority 2: Implement Image Rendering** - Create the paint logic for the `Image` element.
3.  **Priority 3: Enhance Input Manager** - Add `onClick` handlers to UI nodes and invoke them from `Input.ts`.

**Key Insight**: The foundation is solid. The main remaining tasks are to add the specific paint logic for each element type and wire up the already-functional input system to event handler callbacks.
