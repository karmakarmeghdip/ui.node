## üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Critical Missing Pieces

### Phase 1: Core Rendering Pipeline ‚ö° **HIGH PRIORITY**

  - [ ] Generate complete draw command lists for new frames
  - [ ] Connect to existing draw queue system

- [ ] **Refactor Element Style Management** *(~2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Add `isStyleDirty` flag to BaseElement type
  - [ ] Implement `setStyle()` method to replace direct style signal access
  - [ ] Separate layout vs visual-only style updates
  - [ ] Connect style changes to paint pass triggers

#### üî• **Week 3: Integration & Main Loop**
- [ ] **Refactor Main Loop in index.ts** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Remove direct render() calls from setup/resize handlers
  - [ ] Implement proper producer-consumer model
  - [ ] Connect onDraw event to processDrawQueue
  - [ ] Add signal change triggers for paint pass

- [ ] **Add Missing Rendering Functions** *(~2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement actual drawing commands for each element type
  - [ ] Add canvas context drawing for backgrounds, borders, text
  - [ ] Handle image and path rendering

### Phase 2: Complete Element System ‚≠ê **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **October 1, 2025***

#### **Week 4-5: Element Rendering Implementation**
- [ ] **Text Element Rendering** *(~2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement missing `Text.calculateTextElementsDimensions` method
  - [ ] Add proper font handling and text measurement
  - [ ] Connect to canvas text rendering APIs

- [ ] **Image & Path Rendering** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement Image loading and caching system
  - [ ] Add Path drawing with proper SVG path support
  - [ ] Handle async image loading with proper repaints

- [ ] **Style System Enhancements** *(~1-2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Add missing visual style properties (shadows, gradients)
  - [ ] Implement proper style cascading and inheritance
  - [ ] Add style validation and error handling

---

### Phase 3: Input & Event System üéÆ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **October 15, 2025***

#### **Week 6-7: Event Management**
- [ ] **Create EventManager Module** *(~3-4 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement hit-testing algorithm for mouse events
  - [ ] Add event bubbling and capture phases
  - [ ] Connect to existing mouse event handlers in index.ts
  - [ ] Add keyboard event support

- [ ] **State-Driven Rendering** *(~2 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Ensure signal changes properly trigger paint pass
  - [ ] Add debouncing for rapid state changes
  - [ ] Optimize re-render cycles

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features üöÄ **LOW PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **November 15, 2025***

#### **Week 8-10: Enhanced Features**
- [ ] **Style Parser Implementation** *(~3-4 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Design and implement Tailwind-like class system
  - [ ] Add CSS-style property parsing
  - [ ] Create style composition and merging utilities

## üìã **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (This Week)

1. **Start with Paint Pass Implementation** - This is the critical missing piece that will make your current code functional
2. **Focus on 1-2 hour evening sessions** - Small, focused commits are better than large incomplete features
3. **Test incrementally** - Use the existing Layout.test.ts as a model for new tests

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

**By September 15:** You should have a working application that can render basic UI elements reactively  
**By October 1:** Complete element system with proper visual rendering  
**By October 15:** Interactive UI with mouse/keyboard support  
**By November 15:** Feature-complete UI library ready for real applications

## üí° **Development Tips for Evening Work**

- **Keep commits small and focused** - You can complete meaningful work in 1-2 hours
- **Document your stopping points** - Leave clear comments about what to do next
- **Test early and often** - Use `bun test` to ensure changes work
- **Don't aim for perfection** - Get it working first, optimize later
- **Take breaks** - This is a side project, not a sprint

---

## üö® **Blockers & Dependencies**

- **No external blockers identified** - All dependencies are properly set up
- **Missing demo_app import** - The `./test/demo_app` referenced in index.ts doesn't exist, but this won't block core development

---

*Remember: This is an excellent foundation! The architecture is sound, the code quality is high, and you're closer to a working UI library than you might think. The paint pass implementation is the key missing piece that will bring everything together.*
