# Node Skia UI - Development Progress & TODO

*Last updated: September 2, 2025*

> **Development Context**: This project is being developed during evening hours after a day job. Deadlines are intentionally relaxed and realistic to maintain steady progress without burnout.

## üéØ Current Status Overview

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Strong Foundation with Core Components Working
After thorough codebase analysis, the project has significantly more implemented than originally documented. Most core systems are functional and integrated.

**What's Actually Done:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete UI Tree System** - Full UINode implementation with Element, Text, Image, Path types.
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Signals Integration** - Reactive state management with proper subscriptions for styles and input.
- ‚úÖ **Full Layout Engine** - Complete Yoga Layout integration with position calculation.
- ‚úÖ **Layout-Integrated Painting** - Painting is automatically triggered from the layout pass for dirty nodes.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Style System** - Rich style types with layout/visual property separation.
- ‚úÖ **Working Draw Queue Renderer** - Producer-consumer model with command processing, correctly hooked into the window's `frame` event.
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Window Support** - Window creation, management, and proper cleanup.
- ‚úÖ **Complete Input Management** - Hit-testing, mouse event processing, and reactive `clicked`/`hovered` signals fully implemented.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - Layout.test.ts and Renderer.test.ts with 100+ test cases.
- ‚úÖ **Text Rendering** - Complete text rendering implementation with font styling, measurement, and positioning in `paintText` function.

## üöß **ACTUAL GAPS** - Final Integration Steps

### Phase 0: Fix Event Loop Architecture ‚ö° **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **September 12, 2025***

- [ ] **Resolve Node.js Event Loop Blocking** *(~3-5 evening sessions)*
  - **Problem**: Current implementation blocks the Node.js event loop, preventing asynchronous operations and making the app unsuitable for real desktop applications.
  - **Solution Option A**: Use skia-canvas "node" event loop mode with continuous polling (may cause performance issues)
  - **Solution Option B**: Implement dual-thread architecture:
    - Main thread: Handle async I/O operations and application logic
    - Worker thread: Dedicated renderer thread for window management, layout, and rendering
    - Communication via MessagePort between threads
    - Check for messages from parent in the frame handler
  - [ ] Research and prototype both approaches
  - [ ] Implement the chosen solution
  - [ ] Test with async operations to ensure non-blocking behavior

### Phase 1: Complete Remaining Element Renderers ‚ö° **HIGH PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **September 15, 2025***

- [x] **Text Rendering** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Text` element type.
  - [x] Use `skia-canvas` context to draw text based on `style` properties (`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `color`).
  - [x] Implement text measurement for layout (`calculateTextElementsDimensions`).
  
- [ ] **Image & Path Rendering** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Image` element type, including asynchronous image loading.
  - [ ] Implement the `paintNode` case for the `Path` element type, using `skia-canvas` to render SVG-like path data.

### Phase 2: Advanced Interactivity üéÆ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **September 25, 2025***

- [x] **Enhanced Input Manager** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Hit-testing algorithm to find the topmost node under cursor.
  - [x] Reactive `clicked` and `hovered` signals with proper state management.
  - [x] Mouse event processing (mousedown, mouseup, mousemove) integrated with UI tree.

- [ ] **Demo Application** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Fix missing `./test/demo_app` import in `demo_api.js` or create a new entry point.
  - [ ] Create a working demo that showcases interactive elements (buttons, hover effects) to validate the event system.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features üöÄ **LOW PRIORITY**
*Target Completion: **October 15, 2025***

- [ ] **Style Parser** *(~2-3 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement string-based style parsing (e.g., CSS-like or Tailwind-like).
  
- [ ] **Scrollable Elements** *(~3-4 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Implement viewport clipping and scroll offset management.
  
- [ ] **JSX/TSX Support** *(~4-5 evening sessions)*
  - [ ] Set up a JSX runtime to convert JSX syntax into `Element()` factory calls.

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL DEBT & IMPROVEMENTS**

- [ ] **Optimize Layout Performance**: Investigate if the current approach of recalculating layout on any style change can be optimized to only affect the relevant sub-tree.
- [ ] **Error Handling & Validation**: Add input validation for style properties and graceful error handling for asset loading.

## üìã **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (This Week)

1.  **Priority 0: Fix Event Loop Blocking** - Research and implement non-blocking architecture (dual-thread or node event loop mode).
2.  **Priority 1: Implement Image Rendering** - Create the paint logic for the `Image` element.
3.  **Priority 2: Implement Path Rendering** - Create the paint logic for the `Path` element.

**Critical Issue**: The current implementation blocks the Node.js event loop, making it unsuitable for real desktop applications. This must be resolved before continuing with other features.

**Key Insight**: Both text rendering AND input handling are complete, but the blocking event loop architecture is a critical blocker that needs immediate attention.
